                        <p>Let’s imagine an eager, amateur wine drinker. They have just started on their journey to understanding more about wine, something they have wanted to do for years. They have a full-time job, a busy family, a vibrant social calendar, so wine knowledge has always seemed like it would just add another to-do item to their list. They have never been able to feel confident about choosing a wine at a restaurant, let alone buying one for a nice meal at home.</p>

                        <p>Our first version, we moved forward with a live chat feature. But, I found out that people are more interested in having an exploratory tool where they could access information that has been curated and personalized based on a customized criteria. As a result of user surveys and interviews, we used these insights to begin to design for a chatbot interaction.</p>

                        <p>The first visualization we created was the highest possible view we could offer, a more digestible form of a wine chart. This was the first step in moving away price, label, brand as a driving factor, and into an understandable view of wine pairing information.</p><p>With the relentless iterations between UX and UI, we took what we had learned through user stories and flows and produced wireframes that began to bring shape to the chatbot interaction.</p>
                        <p>I started looking at how people were obtaining information and communicating their preferences as inspiration for how we could make their data more approachable. In short order, the chatbot interaction came to life and this is where we focused our efforts as the UI began to take shape.</p>
