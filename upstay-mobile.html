                            <p>Having to open your computer or pick up the phone to make a phone call is not the ideal method of communication for many people looking for seamless services. After managing  requests for and fulfillment of services, we realized that EveryBell clients were ripe for the mobile experience.</p>

                            <p>We decided to take the leap towards exploring an offering a mobile application for the booking experience.

                        <p>Client interviews were thoughtfully constructed around supplying real information about what clients needed in mobile, not what they thought they wanted. Having heard a fair bit of feedback about clients wanting mobile, we took a first stab at what we thought people wanted - we needed to have a baseline to validate and test against.</p>

                        <p>We uncovered user motivations regarding the services that are most widely used at hotels and drew conclusions from this data about relevant services in alternative accommodations. This proved to be a valuable exercise and expanded the product scope to include all relevant services, a frictionless booking process, and a simple payment solution. </p>

                        <p>We slowly started to update the wireframes and test with a set of users.

This included input from hosts and marketing to ensure features were realistic to deliver within our time frame and to ensure the features met strategic business goals. </p>

                    <p>To kickstart the process I created an inventory summarizing the experiences a client would have with the mobile app (below). I took these and broke them down to their core components and began assembling them into wireframe interface elements. From there I worked on how these pieces fit together and affected each other. Using the user flows to direct the wireframing, I proceeded to sketch concepts to address user onboarding, SMS verification, zip code confirmation (property address and access information), account overview and service selection as seen in the screen shots below.</p>

                        <p>Improved communication tools and bringing bookings to mobile phones has increased response times and will have further positive impacts as we continue to refine what and how we build on mobile. With the release of the mobile app prototype we saw a positive impact on user engagement and retention without our test groups.</p><p> Mobile will play a major role in the EveryBell ecosystem, providing an opportunity for guests to book services directly and providers to have a core platform to manage the service execution & fulfillment.<br></p>

                        <p>In terms of next steps, expansion is dependent on data and development resources, with the aim to integrate with service providers to ensure seamless delivery and back-end data integration. Next phases would also include building a robust payment solution with secure processing as a priority to store payments for future purchases. The future of on-demand bookings is also to enable in-app, live chat for 24/7 Concierge for a highly customized experience - which is now the ultimate luxury.</p>
